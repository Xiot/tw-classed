## Importing types

You can import all types at once:

```typescript
import type * as Classed from "@tw-classed/react";
```

These include:

- `Classed.ClassedComponentType` - the type of a classed component
- `Classed.DerivedComponentType` The type of a derived component. (Removing the `as` prop from the base component)
- `Classed.InferVariantProps` Infers the variant props of a set of variants (internal but exported for convenience)
- `Classed.VariantProps` Infers the variant props of a component
- `Classed.Variants` The legal variants of a component (use to type an external variant object)

## Extract variants from a component

```typescript
import type * as Classed from "@tw-classed/react";

const Button = classed("button", "px-2 py-1", {
  variants: {
    color: {
      blue: "bg-blue-500",
      red: "bg-red-500",
    },
  },
});

type ButtonVariants = Classed.VariantProps<typeof Button>;
// {
//     color: "blue" | "red";
// }

export type ButtonProps = React.ComponentProps<typeof Button>; // This of course works as expected
```

### Creating a derived component

Sometimes you might have to extend a component with React logic. You can do this by creating a derived component.

For Typescript to work correctly with the `as` prop you need to override the component's type as `DerivedComponentType` type. This internally removes the `as` prop from the base component.

```tsx
import { DerivedComponentType } from "@tw-classed/react";
import { forwardRef } from "react";
import { classed } from "@tw-classed/react";

const BaseButton = classed("button", "px-2 py-4", {
  variants: {
    color: {
      blue: "bg-blue-500",
      red: "bg-red-500",
    },
  },
});

type BaseButtonProps = React.ComponentProps<typeof BaseButton> & {
  icon?: React.ReactNode; // Add an icon prop
};

const Button = forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, BaseButtonProps>(
  ({ icon, ...props }, ref) => {
    return (
      <BaseButton {...props} ref={ref}>
        {icon && <span className="mr-2">{icon}</span>}
        {props.children}
      </BaseButton>
    );
  }
) as DerivedComponentType<typeof BaseButton, BaseButtonProps>;

() => (
  <Button color="blue" as="a" href="/">
    Click me
  </Button>
);
```

### Typescript 4.9 and above (satisfies api)

On Typescript 4.9 and above you can use the satisfies keyword to define a variant object outside of the `classed` function. This is useful when creating shared variants.

```typescript
import { Variants, classed } from "@tw-classed/react";

const colorVariants = {
  color: {
    blue: "bg-blue-500",
    red: "bg-red-500",
  },
} satisfies Variants;

// In Button.tsx
const Button = classed("button", "px-2 py-1", {
  variants: colorVariants,
});

type ButtonVariants = Classed.VariantProps<typeof Button>; // Variants are persisted.
```
