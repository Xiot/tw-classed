## Importing types

You can import all types at once:

```typescript
import type * as Classed from "@tw-classed/react";
```

These include:

- `Classed.ClassedComponentType` - the type of a classed component
- `Classed.InferVariantProps` Infers the variant props of a set of variants (internal but exported for convenience)
- `Classed.VariantProps` Infers the variant props of a component
- `Classed.Variants` The legal variants of a component (use to type an external variant object)

## Extract variants from a component

```typescript
import type * as Classed from "@tw-classed/react";

const Button = classed("button", "px-2 py-1", {
  variants: {
    color: {
      blue: "bg-blue-500",
      red: "bg-red-500",
    },
  },
});

type ButtonVariants = Classed.VariantProps<typeof Button>;
// {
//     color: "blue" | "red";
// }

export type ButtonProps = React.ComponentProps<typeof Button>; // This of course works as expected
```

### Typescript 4.9 and above (satisfies api)

On Typescript 4.9 and above you can use the satisfies keyword to define a variant object outside of the `classed` function. This is useful when creating shared variants.

```typescript
import {Variants, classed} from "@tw-classed/react";

const colorVariants = {
  color: {
    blue: "bg-blue-500",
    red: "bg-red-500",
  },
} satisfies Classed.Variants;

// In Button.tsx
const Button = classed("button", "px-2 py-1", {
  variants: colorVariants,
});

type ButtonVariants = Classed.VariantProps<typeof Button>; // Variants are persisted.
```
